1- For Backend:
- You need to create a virtual environment so that your local python libraries are not changed.
- Steps to create a virtual env: commands to be run on the terminal in linux:
	1- sudo pip3 install virtualenv
	2- sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper
	3- export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs
	4- mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME
	5- source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
	6- mkvirtualenv env1
	7- workon env1
- Note: We need to put statements 2 and 4 in our ~/.bashrc file
	Note :- After putting statements in .bashrc you need to use
	$ source .bashrc

- After this, go inside the folder containing the manage.py file. Make sure you are on the virtual environment.
-	Now first install all the dependencies:-
		- pip3 install -r requirements.txt (may take a while in downloading the dependencies)

- Then run the following commands to run the backend server:
	-python manage.py migrate
	-python manage.py runserver
- With this, your database will be created and the server will be up and running


2- For frontend:
- Install node and npm in your device from the official site
- Navigate to the folder containing the package.json file and run the following commands:
	- npm install - (may take a while in downloading the node modules)
	- npm start
- With this your frontend server will be up and running.
